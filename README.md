# Pizzaz Cinema

This is an interactive program for a local cinema I have written as part of a University project. 
The program will allow users to view the available movies, order tickets for one or multiple persons, and make transactions on the orders. 
When ordering tickets, further information about each person can be asked. The order can also determine if the number of persons in a group can see the movie. 
Finally, the purchase will involve a transaction between the cinema involving calculations of finance.
Instructions are provided in the comments within the text file.
